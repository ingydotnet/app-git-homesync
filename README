See tmp/depends for the CPAN modules that are currently required.
See tmp/notes for my train of thought.

tmp/shell_cmds can be sourced for helpful shortcuts:
$ . tmp/shell_cmds
$ eval $cmd config --dry-run # Run the "config" action safely
$ eval $test # Run the test suite through prove(1)
$ eval "$test/output.t" # Run just a single test
$ eval $debug_cmd config --dry-run # Use the Perl debugger
$ eval "$debug_test/output.t" # Use the Perl debugger on a test
